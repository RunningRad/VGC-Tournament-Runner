The idea of this program is to allow tournament organizers for Pok√©mon VGC events to have a program that replicates the software used to run PC, MSS, and higher level tournaments.

This can as a result be used for local events that are not at a PC level, allowing for the same system to run tournaments without needing to use a different external software or website.
